# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
The **Face Recognition** project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and verify individuals by analyzing facial features. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to create a robust system capable of recognizing faces from images or video streams. Its applications span various domains such as security, user authentication, and personalized user experiences.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Automatically detects and isolates faces from input images or video streams.
- **Dataset Generation**: Captures and processes facial data to create a comprehensive dataset.
- **Model Training**: Trains a classifier using labeled facial data to recognize specific individuals.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Identifies faces in real-time using a pre-trained model.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include new individuals by updating the dataset and retraining the model.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Dataset Generation**
- **Description**: Captures facial data of individuals to create a labeled dataset.
- **Process**:
  1. Use a camera or image directory as input.
  2. Detect faces using OpenCV.
  3. Save cropped facial regions with appropriate labels.

### 2. **Model Training**
- **Description**: Trains a machine learning model to classify faces based on the dataset.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load the generated dataset.
  2. Extract features from facial images.
  3. Train a classifier such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
  4. Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.

### 3. **Real-Time Recognition**
- **Description**: Recognizes faces from live video streams or images using the trained model.
- **Steps**:
  1. Capture video frames.
  2. Detect faces in each frame.
  3. Predict the identity of each face using the trained classifier.
  4. Display results on the video feed.
